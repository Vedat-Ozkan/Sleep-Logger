Great — I implemented the Phase 1 quick wins from AGENTS.md, mindful of our sandbox limits.

  What I did

  - Sentry (opt‑in, safe init)
      - Added a dynamic init in app/_layout.tsx that won’t crash if the package isn’t installed. To enable, add @sentry/
  react-native and set SENTRY_DSN.
      - You already have src/lib/time.test.ts with robust coverage for formatting, parsing, and UTC↔local conversions.
  - README enhancements
      - Added high-level architecture diagram and CI/test instructions.
      - Provided a coverage badge example and Sentry enablement note.

  Why not semantic-release now?

  - It requires additional dev dependencies or an action that pulls semantic-release at runtime. I can add a release
  workflow scaffold next, but it will only work after you add a GH token and configure the package. If you want that,
  I’ll add .github/workflows/release.yml with semantic-release action and instructions.

  Next options

  - Add @testing-library/react-native and write component/hook tests (e.g., SleepRibbons DayColumn gestures with mocks,
  useSleepEditor state).
  - Wire a release workflow using semantic-release and Conventional Commits.
  - Add a coverage badge from your provider (Codecov/coveralls) to README once configured.

  Want me to proceed with the release workflow scaffolding and a couple of example component tests?
